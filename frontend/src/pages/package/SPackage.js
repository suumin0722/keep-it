                Basic HTML version is the most generic version of Light Blue App
                that can be used with any platform starting from PHP and Rails
                to .NET and Java. It contains pure w3c-validated{" "}
                <strong>HTML5</strong> markup and valid <strong>CSS3</strong>{" "}
                styles. It can work in two modes: (a) as a{" "}
                <strong>Single Page Application</strong>, using ajax to fetch
                page contents, or (b) as a static application, where pages
                served directly from server. The mode can be switched by
                changing the value of &nbsp;<code>window.PJAX_ENABLED</code>{" "}
                global variable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, this version comes with three different color schemes
                which you can easily switch based on your choice.
